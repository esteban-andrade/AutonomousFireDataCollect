# AutonomousFireDataCollect

This repository deals with the Data Monitoring & Collection for Early-Stage Bushfires project for MMD AUT2021 held at UTS.

In recent years, there has been an international increase in the number, severity, and impact of bushfires on rural communities, biodiversity and subsequently both national and international economies. Currently, emergency services have no method to detect or collect data to monitor the early stages of remote bushfires. 


Currently, emergency services have limited methods to collect data to detect or monitor remote bushfires in their early stages. The first step is to build up a dataset of bushfire information from a range of sensors. A basic user-responsive prototype has been produced to collect and monitor bushfire data in low intensity areas which has been showcased here.
